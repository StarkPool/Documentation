> Inspired by ERC-4326, StarkPool offers enhanced features tailored for specific use cases. This smart contract-> based project enables owners to deposit ERC-20 tokens and mint ownership tokens (bearing tokens) for designated recipients, with controlled transferability and additional safeguards.

## **Features**

### **Deposits and Ownership Tokens**

- **Token Deposits:** Owners can deposit ERC-20 tokens into the StarkPool contract.

- **Minting Ownership Tokens**: For each deposit, ownership tokens (bearing tokens) are minted for specified recipients.

### **Restricted Transferability**

- **Whitelisted Transfers**: Bearing tokens can only be transferred to whitelisted addresses, ensuring controlled distribution and reducing the risk of misuse.

### **Redemption**

- **Token Redemption:** Whitelisted addresses holding bearing tokens can redeem the original ERC-20 tokens.

### **Daily Withdrawal Limits**
- **Withdrawal Control:** Owners have the ability to set daily withdrawal limits for whitelisted addresses, providing an additional layer of security and control over token distribution.

### **DAO Crowdfunding and Grants**

- **Voting Tokens:** The protocol supports DAO crowdfunding by allowing users to purchase voting tokens, which act as quadratic voting tools.
- **Project Funding:** These voting tokens contribute to project funding, enabling a decentralized and democratic funding process.

### **Rug Pull Protection**
- **Security Measures:** In the event of a potential rug pull, all users will have their tokens returned, fostering trust within the StarkNet ecosystem.

## **How It Works**
### ***Token Deposit and Minting***
- **Deposit ERC-20 Tokens:** Owners deposit ERC-20 tokens into the StarkPool contract.
- **Mint Bearing Tokens:** Ownership tokens (bearing tokens) are minted for the designated recipients, representing their share of the deposited tokens.


## ***Controlled Transfers***
- **Whitelisting Addresses:** Only addresses that are whitelisted can receive transfers of bearing tokens.
Setting Withdrawal Limits: Owners set daily withdrawal limits for whitelisted addresses to control the redemption process.
